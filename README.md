# Driver test app

## [Live Demo](https://driver-tests.netlify.app/)

Simple app for student drivers to practice their knowledge of traffic rules.

User can select a category and answer series of questions. After the test is finished he gets the results.

Administrator can add and remove questions.

There is no database for this app. Local storage is used.

I built this app with HTML, CSS and JS but I fully realise that a framework and maybe some backend functionality could turn this app into a serious one.
